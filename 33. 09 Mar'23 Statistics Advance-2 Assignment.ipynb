    "1. Probability Mass Function (PMF):\n",
    "The PMF is used for discrete random variables, which take on a countable set of distinct values. It gives the probability that the random variable takes on a specific value. The PMF is defined as:\n",
    "\n",
    "PMF(x) = P(X = x)\n",
    "\n",
    "where X is the random variable and x is a specific value that X can take. The PMF must satisfy two properties: non-negativity and the sum of probabilities must equal 1 over all possible values of X. In other words, for every value of x, PMF(x) ≥ 0, and the sum of PMF(x) over all values of x is 1.\n",

    "The normal distribution, also known as the Gaussian distribution or bell curve, is commonly used as a model in various fields due to its mathematical properties and its applicability to many real-world scenarios. Here are some examples of situations where the normal distribution might be used as a model:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Heights and Weights: The heights and weights of a large population tend to follow a normal distribution, with most individuals clustered around the mean value. The normal distribution allows us to describe the typical height or weight and estimate the likelihood of observing extreme values.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Measurement Errors: In experimental or observational studies, measurement errors often occur due to various factors. Assuming that these errors are normally distributed allows us to model and analyze the data effectively, enabling us to estimate the true values and quantify uncertainties.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. IQ Scores: Intelligence Quotient (IQ) scores are often assumed to follow a normal distribution with a mean of 100 and a standard deviation of 15. This assumption allows for easy interpretation and comparison of IQ scores within a population.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Financial Data: Many financial variables, such as stock returns or asset prices, are often modeled using the normal distribution. Although actual financial data might not perfectly follow a normal distribution, the assumption is made due to its simplicity and practicality for certain applications.\n",

    "The parameters of the normal distribution, namely the mean (μ) and the standard deviation (σ), play a crucial role in determining the shape and characteristics of the distribution:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Mean (μ): The mean represents the central location or average value of the distribution. It determines the location of the peak of the bell curve. Shifting the mean to the right or left changes the central tendency of the distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Standard Deviation (σ): The standard deviation measures the dispersion or spread of the data points around the mean. A smaller standard deviation results in a narrower bell curve, indicating less variability in the data. Conversely, a larger standard deviation leads to a wider bell curve, reflecting more dispersion in the data."

This distribution arises when multiple independent factors contribute to the observed outcome, as described by the Central Limit Theorem. Hence, understanding and modeling the normal distribution allows us to analyze and make predictions about various natural processes.\n",

Its shape is determined by just two parameters: the mean and the standard deviation. This simplicity enables researchers and practitioners to apply statistical methods and perform calculations efficiently.\n",

    "3. Statistical Inference: The normal distribution plays a vital role in statistical inference. Many statistical techniques and tests, such as hypothesis testing, confidence intervals, and regression analysis, rely on the assumption of normality. These methods often assume that the underlying data or errors follow a normal distribution to make valid statistical inferences.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Estimation and Prediction: The normal distribution allows for reliable estimation and prediction. With knowledge of the mean and standard deviation, one can calculate probabilities, percentiles, and confidence intervals.

It states that as the sample size increases, the distribution of sample means or sums will approach a normal distribution. This allows for the estimation of population parameters, such as the mean or proportion, based on the properties of the sample.\n",

    "3. Finite Variance: The random variables must have finite variance. Variance is a measure of the spread or variability of a distribution. Having finite variance ensures that the sum or average of the variables does not become too extreme or divergent.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Sample Size: The Central Limit Theorem states that as the sample size increases, the distribution of the sample mean or sum approaches a normal distribution. The CLT does not specify an exact threshold for the sample size, but a common guideline is that the sample size should be at least 30.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's important to note that violating any of these assumptions may lead to the failure of the Central Limit Theorem. In such cases, alternative statistical methods or modifications of the CLT may be required.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is worth mentioning that there are variations and extensions of the Central Limit Theorem that relax some of these assumptions, such as the Lyapunov CLT and the Lindeberg–Lévy CLT. These variations allow for more flexibility in terms of the types of random variables and the nature of their distribution, but they still require certain conditions to hold for valid application."
