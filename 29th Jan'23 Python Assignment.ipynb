    "Python was developed by Guido van Rossum in the late 1980s and was first released in 1991. Van Rossum continued to oversee the development of Python until 2018, when he retired from his role as \"Benevolent Dictator For Life\" (BDFL) and the Python community adopted a new governance model. Since then, Python has been maintained and developed by a team of volunteers."

    "Memory management in Python is handled automatically by the Python interpreter through a process called Garbage Collection. Python uses a technique called reference counting to keep track of how many references to an object exist in memory. Whenever the reference count of an object drops to zero, Python automatically frees the memory used by that object.\n",

In cyclic garbage collection, Python periodically checks for objects that are part of circular reference cycles and marks them for deletion.\n",

    "Python also includes a built-in memory management module called gc that provides more control over the garbage collection process. For example, you can use the gc.disable() function to temporarily disable garbage collection, or the gc.collect() function to force garbage collection to occur immediately.\n",
