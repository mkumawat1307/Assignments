    "Abstraction is a fundamental concept in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) that refers to the ability to focus on essential features of an object while hiding its complex implementation details. Abstraction allows us to represent complex systems in a simplified manner, making it easier to understand and work with them.\n",

    "`Abstraction` is the process of identifying the essential features of a class and hiding the implementation details. It focuses on what an object does, rather than how it does it. Abstraction helps to simplify the complexity of a system by hiding the non-essential details and exposing only the necessary features to the user.\n",
    "\n",
    "`Encapsulation`, on the other hand, is the process of wrapping the data and code that operate on that data into a single entity, i.e., a class. It is used to restrict direct access to the data and ensure that it is accessed only through well-defined methods or interfaces. Encapsulation provides data security and enhances code maintainability by limiting the direct interaction with the internal state of an object.\n",
    "\n",
    "To better understand the difference between abstraction and encapsulation, let's consider an example of a banking system:\n",
    "\n",
    "`Abstraction:` In a banking system, a customer can perform various operations such as deposit, withdrawal, balance inquiry, etc. However, the customer does not need to know how the bank system manages these operations internally. The bank system can abstract the essential features of these operations, i.e., the inputs and outputs, and expose them to the customer through a well-defined interface, such as a web or mobile application.\n",
    "\n",
    "`Encapsulation:` In a banking system, the customer's account details, such as account number, balance, and transaction history, are sensitive data that should not be accessed directly by anyone. Therefore, the bank system can encapsulate this data by creating a class that represents the customer's account and its associated methods, such as deposit, withdrawal, and balance inquiry. These methods would operate on the account data, ensuring that the data remains secure and is accessed only through the appropriate methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, abstraction and encapsulation are two important concepts of object-oriented programming that play different roles. Abstraction is used to hide implementation details and focus on essential features, while encapsulation is used to protect data and code by wrapping them into a single entity."

Abstract classes define a set of methods that must be implemented by its concrete subclasses, but they do not provide an implementation for those methods themselves. Instead, they only define the method signature (name, parameters, and return type) and any constraints on their behavior.\n",
